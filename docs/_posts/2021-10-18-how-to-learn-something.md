For myself, the process of learning something is:
```
    while (1)
        read classic books
        do some related practice
    end while
```

Here are two examples.

### Example 1 Programming

First step, read classic books. Currently, I'm reading [The C Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Dennis-M-Ritchie/dp/0876925964) and [The UNIX Programming Environment](https://www.amazon.com/Unix-Programming-Environment-Prentice-Hall-Software/dp/013937681X).
The former shows that nearly everything I am interested about **C**, and the latter gives me capability to delve into the world of **UNIX OS**.

Second step, do some practice. Both of books provide exercises, and I try to give answers based on my understanding. 
I manage them in [my github repository](https://github.com/guo-sj/):

- [The C Programming Language Exercises](https://github.com/guo-sj/c-language-exercise)
- [The UNIX Programming Environment Exercises](https://github.com/guo-sj/The-UNIX-Programming-Environment)

Although doing exercises costs a lot of time and makes reading little slow, it is salutary and **do** improve my programming ability, and I recommand everyone who want to learn programming doing like that.

Finally, iterate to first step, then second step and go on. Read a little, write a little, that's all!

# Example 2 Ping Pong

First step, read classic books - [乒乓球 直板反胶打法训练](https://book.douban.com/subject/3004601/), written by WuJingping, who is 
one of the most famous chinese national coaches. This book could answer any questions about Ping Pong of mine.

Second step, do some practice. I give 10 minutes of my lunch time to practice Ping Pong everyday, and try to deploy points in the book during the process. I have to say that it's effective to level my skill up.

Finally, go to the first step, then second step and go on.
