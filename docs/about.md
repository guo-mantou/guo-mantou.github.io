My name is GuoShijie (郭世杰), and I'm a software engineer based in Nanjing, China.

During the day, I work as a junior software engineer for [FNST](https://www.fujitsu.com/cn/microsite/fnst/) where I'm involved in designing and delivering software projects.

Personal hobbies include coding, reading, learning and Ping Pong.

You can find a bit about me elsewhere on the Internet here: [Github](https://github.com/guo-sj).

And [my resume](todo-link).
